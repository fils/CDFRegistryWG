# schema builder

## About
A simple program that right now just sets values in a struct and 
converts this to valid JSON-LD using schema.org vocabulary.  

Finishing out the struct based on formalizing the terms and 
references for a repository would be rather easy.  Once done 
adding a simple form interface and allowing people to populate the results 
and obtain a generated JSON-LD is straightforward.
