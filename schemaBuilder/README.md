# schema builder

## Notes
This is just a concept..   it is not even working.   In the end it will likely be something like http://www.stoumann.dk/examples/editor/  to 
give people a general idea of what a document might look like.   The general idea with this approach is to make something that could 
take YAML file, for example, and generate a valid JSON-LD.

## See Also
Look in the notebooks section of this repository for a python based example of this.

## About
A simple program that right now just sets values in a struct and 
converts this to valid JSON-LD using schema.org vocabulary.  

Finishing out the struct based on formalizing the terms and 
references for a repository would be rather easy.  Once done 
adding a simple form interface and allowing people to populate the results 
and obtain a generated JSON-LD is straightforward.
