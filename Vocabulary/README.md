# Vocabulary


## Ontology
The ecrwgOnt.ttl is an ontology version of re3data terms

## SKOS
This directory contains some automatically generated SKOS vocabularies for terms used
by re3data in their schema.  This was done as a test only to provide some simple URIs for 
use in testing.  This testing is mostly just using them in a some test JOSN-LD with schema.org Types 
these voc terms.

This is NOT a published or sanctioned vocabulary.  It is for mocking and testing only.
