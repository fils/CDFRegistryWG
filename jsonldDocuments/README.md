# JOSN-LD Documents

## About
This section contains some of the example JSON-LD documents being created by the 
working group.  Some of these are dated, so tke caution when reviewing them.  Eventually 
we should purge out bad examples.

* dataCatalogExamples: A directory with some examples of using the schema.org/DataCatalog type.
* facilityExamples: These are some local copies of the files being exposed by the facilities.  To be 
current you should always pull the document form the facility domain though and not use these static copies.
* josnldExamples: These are some working files sometimes used to show examples of property and type use.  
The also represent testing the use of various types for the roles needed by the RWG.  To that point, there are examples in here of what we now know to be improper type usage.  Buyer beware!
